The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.
The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other hand, if the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters or numbers that appears in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.

The following example game illustrates a player trying to guess the word hangman using a strategy based solely on letter frequency. To play, the computer will select a word and you will have to guess the correct letters. If you guess the wrong letter, a part of the stick figure on a noose is added. If you get a full body, you are disqualified. You can restart the game if you want.

The guessing player has lost this game as the diagram had been completed before all the letters were guessed.
